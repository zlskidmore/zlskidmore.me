My research focuses on the development of software to aid in the interpretation of genomic mechanisms as they relate to cancer, as well as the utilization of these software in analyzing large cohorts across a breadth of cancer types. In addition to my primary research focus, I am involved in the creation of educational resources in the areas of bioinformatics, genomic data visualization, cancer genomics and transcriptomics, and precision medicine. I have contributed to the development and delivery of more than ten educational workshops both domestically and internationally.</p>
